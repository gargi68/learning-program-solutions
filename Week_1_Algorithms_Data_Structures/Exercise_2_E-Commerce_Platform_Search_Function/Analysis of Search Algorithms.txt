- Linear Search:
  - Time complexity: O(n)
  - Works on unsorted data
  - Simple to implement
  - Becomes inefficient for large datasets

- Binary Search:
  - Time complexity: O(log n)
  - Requires the data to be sorted
  - Much faster for large datasets
  - Efficient and scalable for search-heavy applications

- Suitability for an E-commerce Platform:
  - Binary search is more suitable when product lists are large and sorted
  - Provides better performance for frequent search operations
  - Linear search may be acceptable for small datasets or temporary data
  - For best real-world performance, consider using optimized data structures like hash maps or database indexing
