What is recursion?
Recursion is a programming technique where a method calls itself to solve a smaller instance of the same problem. It helps simplify problems that can be broken down into smaller sub-problems.

Why use recursion?
It is useful in problems like:
1. Tree/graph traversal
2. Divide and conquer algorithms
3. Problems with repetitive patterns (like Fibonacci, factorial, etc.)
4. Financial predictions where each value depends on the previous one
